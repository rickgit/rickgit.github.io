"Reinforcement Learning (RL)"->"The simplified way of implementing a process that improves machine performance with time is using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Reinforcement Learning is an approach through which intelligent programs, known as agents, work in a known or unknown environment to constantly adapt and learn based on giving points. The feedback might be positive, also known as rewards, or negative, also called punishments."

/**
•	 The agent is the intelligent program
•	 The environment is the maze
•	 The state is the place in the maze where the agent is
•	 The action is the move we take to move to the next state
•	 The reward is the points associated with reaching a particular
state.
